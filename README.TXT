PROJECT TITLE: LIA programming
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: School
VERSION or DATE: Draft, 28/04/2025
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: Charles-David, Aadam, Beya
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Use the App constructure to proceed with the app. This will essentially allow you to follow pretty quickly with the rest of the app.

This is a simple Java project built in BlueJ, based on a UML diagram we designed earlier.
The goal was to take the UML plan and implement it in BlueJ, as the beginning of our LIA.

The project includes multiple classes, methods, and some basic object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance.
